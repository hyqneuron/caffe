Steps for completing a model
0. Create backup directory
   - remove conf_*
   - copy over *.prototxt, 
   - copy over info_*
   - copy over caffe.INFO
   - copy over train.txt and test.txt
   - copy over ptxt*
1. Test on testing set
   - Change solver.prototxt's test iteration to 400
   - Change solver.prototxt's maximum iteration to last snapshot's iter
   - train with solver.prototxt with last snapshot
   - Create backup_folder/conf.test
     - move over conf_*
2. Test on training set
   - Change solver.prototxt's test iteration to 3500
   - Change train_val.prototxt's testing source to train.txt
   - train with solver.prototxt with last snapshot
   - Create backup_folder/conf.train
     - move over conf_*
3. Finalize
   - revert solver.prototxt's test iteration to 200
   - revert train_val.prototxt's testing source to test.txt
   - git add -f backup_folder
   - move caffemodel and solverstate to backup_folder
