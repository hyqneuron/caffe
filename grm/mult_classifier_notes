What hasn't been done:
- saree not added
- class imbalance not adjusted
- not much cleaning
  - pattern: all the printed things
  - occasion: I think the current values under the occasion attribute are
    somewhat non-sensical

What has been done 
- a new multi-classifier network architecture
- a new input data layer for the new arch


The new arch exists in: models/yq_fk1/train_val.prototxt

=======================================
multi-classifier network arch
=======================================
The new network arch is like this:

input layer
-> layer 1 
-> layer 2 
-> l3 
-> l4 
-> l5 
-> fc6 
-> fc7 
->   (fc8_category -> loss_category)
     (fc8_pattern  -> loss_pattern)
     (fc8_git      -> loss_fit)
     (fc8_sleeve   -> loss_sleeve)
     ... one per supported attribute

=======================================
new input layer
=======================================
The input layer is now ImageDataMultLabelLayer. It's similar to ImageDataLayer,
but instead of accepting a single label per sample, it accepts a variable number
of labels. 

For example, below is the our input layer definition (in models/yq_fk1)

layer {
  name: "data"
  type: "ImageDataMultLabel"
  top: "data"
  top: "label_category"
  top: "label_pattern"
  top: "label_neck"
  top: "label_sleeve"
  top: "label_fit"
  top: "label_ideal_for"
  top: "label_occasion"
  include {
    phase: TRAIN
  }
  transform_param {
    mirror: true
    crop_size: 227
    mean_file: "data/ilsvrc12/imagenet_mean.binaryproto"
  }
  image_data_mult_label_param {
    source: "/mnt/images/training/flipkart_yq2set/train.txt"
    #source: "/home/noid/grm/data/flipkart/train.txt"
    batch_size: 50
    new_height: 256
    new_width: 256
  }
}

As you can see, it's one top per extra label. And here's an example line in
train.txt:
